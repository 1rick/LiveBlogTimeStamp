Just a simple TextMate snippet to use when live-blogging an event. Press **ll+TAB** (that's lowercase 'L' x 2) and the time will be automatically inserted as an anchor link for that particular update. 

####Recommendation for use
If you're going to actually update your live-blog from TextMate ([more on that here](http://1rick.com/blog/wordpress-textmate)), I recommend starting your post draft in Wordpress, and adding a lead image. Then go to TextMate, and select BUNDLES > BLOGGING > FECTH POST, and select your new post. You can change status from *'draft'* to *'publish'* in the header when ready to publish it live.
